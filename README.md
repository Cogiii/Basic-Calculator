# Basic-Calculator
Welcome to the my first Basic-Calculator app! This JavaScript-based calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, handle special characters, and supports error handling for syntax errors. The interface includes functionalities such as backspace, clear, and automatic comma insertion for better readability. Feel free to integrate and customize this calculator into your web projects. Happy calculating!

This is a simple calculator I've built to practice my JavaScript skills. I plan to enhance it in the future, exploring new features and making it even more powerful.
